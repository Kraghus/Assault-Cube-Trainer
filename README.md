# Assault Cube Trainer
Works for v1.2.0.2

Includes:

1) Max Stats + Invincibility
2) Infinite Ammo
3) No Recoil
4) 2x Player Speed (BUGGY)
5) 2x Jump Height (Coming Soon)
6) No Collision (Coming Soon)

8) Teleport to Coordinates (Coming Soon)
9) 1 Shot Kills (Coming Soon)

Will add a command line interface after all functionality has been implemented.

This is my first attempt at developing a basic trainer. I chose assault cube because it's an old game that is relatively easy to reverse engineer.
